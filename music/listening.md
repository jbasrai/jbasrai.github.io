# Listening

## Immersive Listening

The goal here is to listen to the music deeply, as if you were at a live performance. Your subconscious mind should be engaged, with your conscious mind attentive but quiet. Ward off wandering thoughts and let the richness and artistry in the music capture your attention. Don't narrow your focus on any one thing – appreciate the details but keep your perspective wide open. Think about "drinking fully". It's ok to miss things here, in fact it's expected. The point is not to listen perfectly, but to be fully in the moment – resist the urge to rewind the music to catch something you missed.
