## January 9

This is a sampler of some jazz recordings that I like. Listen to this list during the week, and if a song catches your ear, write it down in your lesson book. Don't worry if nothing stands outi, we'll still have time to find a song.

## October 3

- Instead of making a backing track for "Original Rag", I would just check out a recorded version, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msNjpgkrTW0) and play along. Youtube also has a function to slow down the playback, so that you can work up to the full tempo.
- Reminder to pick out a Christmas tune this week. If possible, let me know what it is before the lesson, so I can take a listen to it. Thanks!
