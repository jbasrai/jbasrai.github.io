# Hope's Mailbox

## September 26
### Lesson Notes
#### Repeat After Me
- parent says/sings note numbers (1-5) and Hope plays it back
- it can be fun to switch roles too
- try to have Hope use her thumb to play "1"

#### Jingle Bells
- focus on learning first half of the tune (ending on "Jingle all the way")
- sing the words while playing
- [backing track](./jingle backing.mp3)

#### Compose a Christmas tune
- bring some words into the next lesson that could be used to start a Christmas tune (1 or 2 phrases)

### Example practice plan
- set 5 minute timer
- start with some "Repeat After Me"
- play Jingle Bells with backing track
- spend a few minutes working on any weak spots
- some free play to end the lesson, Hope's choice


## September 20

- ["Jingle Bells" melody](./jingle.jpg)
- [My favorite Christmas albums](/christmas) -- Let's start brainstorming what Christmas song we want to learn for the studio's Winter Recital in mid-December

## September 9
- ["Mary Had A Little Lamb"](./mary.mp3) -- play the 2 note chords we learned while singing the melody -- chords are C E and B D, parent can play C and G underneath these respective chords
- [keyboard note chart](https://www.lorenz.com/Files/Files/Lorenz/Products/Product_Images/PP314.jpg) --  Hope doesn't need to learn this yet, but can be useful for parent to help find notes
- improvise with the notes in a C chord (C E G) over [backing track](./backing.mp3) -- [example](./example.mp3)
- bring a short list of songs that you'd be interested in learning to the next lesson (can be any genre)
- [Shinunoga E-wa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dawrQnvwMTY) -- this is the song the student before you was working on, which you were enjoying
