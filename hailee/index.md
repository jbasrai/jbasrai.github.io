## August 12
- [ear training quiz: single tones](./ear.mp3) - Identify each pitch, either 1, 3, or 5 (key of Eb). Write down your guesses the first time through, and then check it with the piano afterwards. Practice singing any pitches that you're having trouble identifying. Repeat this quiz whenever you sit down to practice, until you're getting 100% and feeling confident.
- [backing track for improvisation (key of Eb)](./backing.mp3) - Think about target notes this week.
- [example improvisation](./improv.mp3)

## July 29
- [ear training test: slow resolutions](./ear.mp3) - identify each resolution that starts on the 1, 3, or 5. Write down your guesses, and then check with the piano afterwards (key of C)

- [verse](./verse.mp3)
- [prechorus](./prechorus.mp3) - chords: E, F#-, D (chord timing is a bit different than verse/chorus)
- [chorus](./chorus.mp3)

### Listening this week
- [John Prine](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7lHkugF0nyI) - Listen for the guitar playing on this record, we use a lot of these figures and rhythms on the piano also


## June 28

- [I Need Thee Every Hour](./hymn.mp3)
- [Blossom Dearie](https://youtube.com/watch?v=pETdS7_wXHU) - I listened to this album recently and really liked it. Blossom Dearie plays piano + sings on this one. It should be on Apple Music too if you want to listen to it in the car.

- ["Same God" key change](./samegod.mp3)

## May 9

### Few thoughts for this week
- Keep up doing performance runs every day this week. See if you can record yourself and listen back to identify spots that need work.

### It's Too Late: Live Performances
- watch for inspiration, pay special attention to Carole King's singing this week and see what ideas you can grab onto

## When You're Smiling

goal for this week: learn the melody + lyrics and practice singing it (don't need to learn on the piano, we'll pick a key next week)

## November 26

- [example head with LH comping](./1126 head.mp3)
- [backing track](./1126 backing.mp3)
- [example solo](./1126 soloing.mp3)

## November 13

Main goal: Be able to do a performance run of the tune from start to end

- Break up the performance into chunks, and practice small sections at a time
- Chunk #1: Playing the head, lightly embellishing the melody while comping with the LH. You can work on this hands separate until each part feels comfortable then start putting the hands together.
- Chunk #2: Soloing over the tune -- focus on heavily embellishing the melody
- Chunk #3: Playing the head out in 6ths -- listen to Norah Jones' solo and and try to copy her feel

Secondary goal: transcribe (write out the notes to) the B section of White Christmas. Use the written music to help you experiment with *anticipating* notes.

## November 5

## October 8

### G Major Scale
- I forgot to mention this in the lesson, but the scale sounds good with hands separate, so let's start putting them together. Keep practicing with the metronome.
- Practice playing the scale using 6ths, with one note in each hand. Start with G in the RH and B in the LH, play up and down one octave. Once this feels easy, start noodling around and improvising using 6ths.

### Improvising in G Major
- Improvise over G - D - G
- Come up with a 3-note skeleton, with one note over each chord
- Then add 1 passing tone between each note, so that you're playing 2 notes per chord
- Once you feel like you have control, try adding more passing tones, and improvising more freely over the skeleton.
- Try imagining like you're drawing a line on paper, paying attention to which direction the line is moving and which shape it makes

### White Christmas
- Polish up the A section, playing it with the metronome at 108
- Learn the B section, I'll put up the notes for this later this week, so you can check your answers.
- Start adding a "back and forth" texture in the LH. [audio example](./108.mp3)
- Practice this LH only first, then add RH


## September 23
### repeat after me - key of G, 1 measure of G chord + 1 measure of D chord
- [guidetones](./guidetones.mp3)
- [melodies](./melodies.mp3) - each one repeats twice to give you more time to hear it

### some christmas albums to check out
- A Dave Brubeck Christmas
- I Dream Of Christmas (Norah Jones)
- A Charlie Brown Christmas (Vince Guaraldi)

## 8/5

Don't worry about working on the rhythms we did in the lesson just yet, we'll revisit it at the next lesson

## 7/23

- [hymn sheet music](723 king.jpg) - can you also print this out and bring it to the lesson this week?
- [how it sounds](723 king.mp3) - try to first figure out the notes by yourself, and then only then use the recording to check your work

## 7/7

### Assignments for this week:
1. Write the words to a simple song. Take ideas from the nursery rhymes we looked at.
2. Practice finding Bb, Eb, F chords. Play the root down in the bass with the LH, and the triad in the middle of the piano with the RH. Practice singing the bass note.
3. Start learning chords to the chorus of Rocket Man.
4. Learn the 2nd ending of Pleasant Moments. Also start filling in the different chords with the LH.
5. Improvise over the tune by making up some rules. Keep the LH simple and play a G chord on the downbeat.

- ["pleasant moments" melody with a metronome](629 pleasant.mp3)
- [answers to where the chords change on "rocket man", feel free to only look after you've written in your best guesses](629 rocket.jpg)

### Some example improvisation rules
- improvise using only the rhythm of the first phrase in "Pleasant Moments"
- make phrases that go up and then come back down
- start and end your phrase on "D"
- use only "jumps", like "Bb <-> F", "D <-> Bb", or "F <-> D"
- use a lot of repeated notes
- use only 2 bar phrases

## 6/21
- [repeat after me](./621 ear.mp3) - In this recording, I'm making phrases using the first 5 notes of our 5 note scale: G, A, B, D, E. I play each phrase twice, you can then repeat back the phrase twice also.
- slight change to the lesson plan this week: Let's ignore the G - C minor improvisation that we did at the end of the lesson. Instead, can you learn the lyrics to "Rocket Man", focusing on the words in the chorus.

## 4/25
- [pitch recognition](./4 25 slow.mp3) - there are 10 questions, for each question I'll play a pitch, name whether the pitch is the 1st scale degree (G) or the 3rd scale degree (B). write down your answers and compare with my answers below
- [answers to above](./4 25 answers.jpg)
- after you do this, for more practice, feel free to review the pitches OR have a family member test you by playing a G chord in their LH and either a G or B in their RH
- [repeat after me ear training](./4 25 ear.mp3) - after you go through this tape, feel free to review it OR improvise some of your own melodies
- [good morning backing track to practice LH rhythm](./425 rhythm.mp3) - the clicks of the metronome will help you time the LH hits
