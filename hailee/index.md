## 6/21
- [repeat after me](./621 ear.mp3) - In this recording, I'm making phrases using the first 5 notes of our 5 note scale: G, A, B, D, E. I play each phrase twice, you can then repeat back the phrase twice also.
- slight change to the lesson plan this week: Let's ignore the G - C minor improvisation that we did at the end of the lesson. Instead, can you learn the lyrics to "Rocket Man", focusing on the words in the chorus.

## 4/25
- [pitch recognition](./4 25 slow.mp3) - there are 10 questions, for each question I'll play a pitch, name whether the pitch is the 1st scale degree (G) or the 3rd scale degree (B). write down your answers and compare with my answers below
- [answers to above](./4 25 answers.jpg)
- after you do this, for more practice, feel free to review the pitches OR have a family member test you by playing a G chord in their LH and either a G or B in their RH
- [repeat after me ear training](./4 25 ear.mp3) - after you go through this tape, feel free to review it OR improvise some of your own melodies
- [good morning backing track to practice LH rhythm](./425 rhythm.mp3) - the clicks of the metronome will help you time the LH hits

- [a bass player using our same 1-5 texture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTLz4hr18vE), notice that the mandolin player (the one with his back to us) is playing chords on the offbeat, just like we're doing
