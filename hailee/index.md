- [pitch recognition](./4 25 slow.mp3) - there are 10 questions, for each question I'll play a pitch, name whether the pitch is the 1st scale degree (G) or the 3rd scale degree (B). write down your answers and compare with my answers below
- [answers to above](./4 25 answers.jpg)
- after you do this, for more practice, feel free to review the pitches OR have a family member test you by playing a G chord in their LH and either a G or B in their RH
- [repeat after me ear training](./4 25 ear.mp3) - after you go through this tape, feel free to review it OR improvise some of your own melodies
