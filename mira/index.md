## March 18 Lesson Notes

### Mira's Tune
- finish chords for 1st and 2nd ending

### Mr. Cool
- get voicings solid
- practice playing the voicings in whole notes on the downbeat

### Blues
- practice comping with 3+7 voicings (2 note)
- start by just playing voicings on the downbeat
- then add rhythm
- then create tiny melodies with the top note, still targeting the voicing for the next chord

### Practice tools
- [blues backing track](./blues.mp3)
- [mr cool backing track](./mrcool.mp3)
- I recommend the following practice tools:
- Amazing Slow Downer
- iReal Pro

## March 6 Lesson Notes

### Mr. Cool
- learned 4 note chord voicings with 3+7 in the LH and color tones in the RH
- NOTE: We should change the F -> F# in our F7 chord to better fit the melody

### Hesitation Blues
- practiced playing the head not only with good notes and rhythm, but also good feel and energy
- soloing concept: fluidly moving around the F major pentatonic scale, constant quarter note and eighth note exercise
- soloing concept: picking a target note on the downbeat, starting with the 1 and 5
- check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWjhdQdgCm4) out, I got reminded of it when we talked about that chord-emoji video

## November 27

- [backing track for solo](./1127.mp3)
- lesson recap:
- singing slow tones over the vamp (1 note per 4 measures)
- speeding it up, 1 note per chord, we called these "target notes"
- (do a 50/50 mix of singing alone, and then playing along as you sing)
- introduce 1 or more "passing notes" to connect these target notes
- start adding in more target notes and passing notes, start improvising more freely

## November 5

- [backing track](./backing.mp3)

## October 25

*plan for next week*

### Christmastime Is Here
- polish up "block chord" texture (4 note voicing in LH, melody in RH)
- play chords with bass note + 3/7 voicing, would be good to sing melody over this as well

### blues
- practice comping with bass + 2 note voicings, practice using both strict patterns (e.g. the charleston) and a free approach

### happy birthday
- we'll practice improvising with the melody next week, so keep it under your fingers

## October 19

### chords for Christmastime Is Here
- F Maj 7 // F A C E
- Eb7#11 // Eb G Bb Db
- BÃ¸7 // B D F A
- A-7 // A C E G
- G-7 // G Bb D F
- C over F // F C E G

We'll start the next lesson with a mock performance of the A section to Christmastime Is Here, here is an [audio example](./1019.mp3) of sort of what I'm looking for

### Goals this week
#### Slow singing
- Play random pitches in the bass range
- Match pitch with voice
- Then practice singing major 3rds

#### Blues roots
- Be able to play roots in LH
- Then play + sing
- Then sing without the piano
- Play with "Tenor Madness" track

#### Blues 3rds
- Play root in LH and 3rd in RH (remember that C-7 is the only chord with a minor 3rd)
- Then play the same thing while singing the 3rd
- Then play just the root while singing the 3rd
- Play everything with "Tenor Madness"

#### Blues 7ths
- Play root in LH and 3rd + 7th in RH (each voicing will either be 3-7 or 7-3)
- Play the same thing while singing the middle voice
- Play the same thing while singing the top voice
- Play everything with "Tenor Madness"


## September 1
