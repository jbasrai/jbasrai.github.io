### Example practice plan

* This is a nice structured 20-30 minute practice session. Would be really nice to do this consistently every day.
* Drum backing track is the "Drumgenius" app
* Drone tracks are "Musician's Practice Partner Cello Drones"

#### Drone warmup (5 min)
- Put on a [drone](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UfY3u7xvgf8)
- Sing the 1
- Sing resolutions to 1, e.g. 7->1, 2->1
- Sing the 3
- Sing resolutions to 3, e.g. 4->3, 2->3
- Slow improvisation, keeping some attention on how notes feel when they suspend and resolve

#### V7->I progression (5 min)
- Play 5 in bass with LH, sing 4
- Then, play 1 in bass, sing 3, and notice the feeling of that resolution
- Play 5 with LH, sing 7
- Then, play 1 with LH, sing 1, notice that resolution
- Play 5 LH, 4 & 7 RH ==> 1 LH, 3 & 1 RH
- Also the other inversion, 7 & 4 in RH
- Slow improvisation going between these 2 chords, feeling tension over V7 chord and release on the I chord
- You can free up RH to improvise, by moving all the notes to the LH
- Example in key of Bb: V7: Eb F A => I: D F Bb. [Example improvisation](./v7.mp3)

#### Work on a tune (10 min)
These are various things to practice. Move slowly through the list, maybe covering just 1 or 2 topics per day. Aim to really master these, so you can do them without thinking. Break tune up into smaller sections and loop these sections, so that there's no part of the tune that feels iffy.

- Melody of tune
- Bass movement
- Melody + bass. [Example](./m+b.mp3)
- Bass in LH, sing 3rd of chord (or play in RH). [Example over Sunny Side of the Street](./3.mp3)
- Bass in LH, sing voice lead lines (top note stays or only moves by a half/whole step). Top note will try to be the 3rd of the chord, or some kind of suspension leading into the 3rd of next chord. [Example starting on G](./vl.mp3)
- Do it in the other inversion, by starting on the 7th of the first chord. [Example starting on C](./vli.mp3)
- Put both voices together to form 2 note chords. Keep an awareness of the voice leading. Practice other inversion also. [Example](./2c.mp3)
- Comp more musically, adding rhythm and interaction. [Example](./comping.mp3)

#### Work on another tune (10 min)
- Same as above. If you were focusing on melody before, maybe switch to harmony or vice versa.

## May 7

- Let's decide by this Saturday if you'd like to perform in the Spring Recital -- send me a email/text letting me know
- Start each practice session by doing a cold performance run -- imagine like you're in a performance, and play the tune from beginning to end with no stopping or starting over
- The way this might look for our tune: Play head, improvise over simplified chord progression (Ab F7 Bb- Eb7), play head out
- Start working on stomp section if you can get through this arrangement without issues
- Let me know if you'd like to schedule an extra lesson this week over Zoom (no cost, since I owe you time)

## April 30

### LH progression
- play roots
- play chords
- (spend more time on A2 to get it solid)
- play roots on beat 1 + 3, chords on beat 2 + 4 (stride pattern)

### RH progression
- play rhythm of melody on 1 note
- same thing, but that note can move to fit the chord
- play melody using 2 notes (neighbor tones)
- play chords in RH with melody note on top (can start with whole notes)
- play chords in RH with melody note + neighbor tone, making a 4 note chord (we didn't do this in the lesson, but would be a good step to practice)
- play the actual melody of the tune, with the rest of the chord underneath (chord hits with all notes)
- play chord only when you're playing the upper neighbor melody note (so your 4th finger will play by itself, and your 1,2,5 fingers will play together)

### practice tips
- mix and match these 2 progressions freely
- experiment with different tempos, especially very slow
- loop small sections at a time

### soloing
- practice soloing over a simplified progression: Ab, F7, Bb-, Eb7 (2 bars each)
- some soloing concepts:
- solo only with whole notes, only changin the note if it sounds bad with the chord, or if you really hear it moving
- next, add rhythm so that you're only playing 1 note per chord, but with rhythm
- next, experiment with neighbor tones (still thinking about 1 note per chord)

## April 8

### King Porter Stomp exercises

- walking half notes and clapping the melody
- tapping quarter notes in LH and tapping the melody in the RH
- playing chords in LH and tapping the melody in the RH
- for the rest of the exercises, you can 1) have LH do nothing, 2) tap quarter notes in LH, or 3) play chords in LH
- playing melody on 1 note
- playing melody with 2 neighbor notes
- play whole note chords in RH
- play 1 note melody with chord underneath
- play 2 note melody with chord underneath 

Some other things:
- Rhythm and feel will be the most important thing for this tune, so spend a lot of time with the basics and get them very solid
- Practice with a metronome, use it to help you slow your practice down
- I think it would be good to learn a couple melodic "licks" for the turnarounds. We can use the ones [circled here in the sheet music](./melody.jpg)

Let's keep using that reverse calendar to help keep us organized for the recital. I'll write out a rough schedule here, but feel free to change anything.

- May 18: Spring recital
- May 13: Have tune performance ready. Do a couple practice runs at the lesson, but no major changes after this point.
- May 6: Develop B section.
- April 29: Develop stomp section. Basic version of B section.
- April 22: Add last few embellishments to A section melody. Be able to do a simple solo over the A section. Basic version of stomp section.
- April 15: Be able to play A section with LH chords, 2-note RH melodies + hits, and turnaround licks.

## March 18 Lesson Notes

### Mira's Tune
- finish chords for 1st and 2nd ending

### Mr. Cool
- get voicings solid
- practice playing the voicings in whole notes on the downbeat

### Blues
- practice comping with 3+7 voicings (2 note)
- start by just playing voicings on the downbeat
- then add rhythm
- then create tiny melodies with the top note, still targeting the voicing for the next chord

### Practice tools
- [blues backing track](./blues.mp3)
- [mr cool backing track](./mrcool.mp3)
- I recommend the following practice tools:
- Amazing Slow Downer
- iReal Pro

## March 6 Lesson Notes

### Mr. Cool
- learned 4 note chord voicings with 3+7 in the LH and color tones in the RH
- NOTE: We should change the F -> F# in our F7 chord to better fit the melody

### Hesitation Blues
- practiced playing the head not only with good notes and rhythm, but also good feel and energy
- soloing concept: fluidly moving around the F major pentatonic scale, constant quarter note and eighth note exercise
- soloing concept: picking a target note on the downbeat, starting with the 1 and 5
- check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWjhdQdgCm4) out, I got reminded of it when we talked about that chord-emoji video

## November 27

- [backing track for solo](./1127.mp3)
- lesson recap:
- singing slow tones over the vamp (1 note per 4 measures)
- speeding it up, 1 note per chord, we called these "target notes"
- (do a 50/50 mix of singing alone, and then playing along as you sing)
- introduce 1 or more "passing notes" to connect these target notes
- start adding in more target notes and passing notes, start improvising more freely

## November 5

## October 25

*plan for next week*

### Christmastime Is Here
- polish up "block chord" texture (4 note voicing in LH, melody in RH)
- play chords with bass note + 3/7 voicing, would be good to sing melody over this as well

### blues
- practice comping with bass + 2 note voicings, practice using both strict patterns (e.g. the charleston) and a free approach

### happy birthday
- we'll practice improvising with the melody next week, so keep it under your fingers

## October 19

### chords for Christmastime Is Here
- F Maj 7 // F A C E
- Eb7#11 // Eb G Bb Db
- BÃ¸7 // B D F A
- A-7 // A C E G
- G-7 // G Bb D F
- C over F // F C E G

We'll start the next lesson with a mock performance of the A section to Christmastime Is Here, here is an [audio example](./1019.mp3) of sort of what I'm looking for
