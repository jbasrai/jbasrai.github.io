Assignment this week: Learn simple melodies in the key of C.

I have some examples on [this page](/simple). If you'd like more song ideas, check out "101 Gang Songs" by Bing Crosby.

Also here is some extra listening with some songs you might enjoy. Feel free to dig into these artists for more similar music.
