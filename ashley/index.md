Assignment this week: Learn simple tunes in the key of C. RH plays the melody, LH plays triads. You might need to experiment with your chord choice and the timing you play it with the melody.

I have some examples on [this page](/simple). If you'd like more song ideas, check out "101 Gang Songs" by Bing Crosby.

Lastly, could you send me some songs that you'd be interested in working on sometime before our next lesson? That will give me time to listen and prepare a bit.
