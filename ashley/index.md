Have a good winter break! Here are a few couple ideas to play with during the holidays.

### Play some Christmas tunes
- Download [iRealPro](https://www.irealpro.com/)

### Learn song from Berserk
- Mix of D Major / D minor
- 3 -> b3, 6 -> b6, 7 -> b7
- [sheet music](./berserk.pdf)
- DMaj7 = D F# A C#
- BbMaj7 = Bb D F A
- Improvise over these 2 chords, using the major scale over DMaj7 and the minor scale over BbMaj7

### Composition exercise
- Write out some 4 bar chord progressions and check out how they sound
- Start by playing root position chords, and then get comfortable playing inversions

## September 4

Here are a couple classical pieces that might be fun to learn. Give them a listen, and maybe we can start working on one of them in the next lesson.

- [Chopin Waltz No. 19 in A minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-voZrgjUVc)
- [Clementi Sonatina No. 6 in D Major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDlsG7C5PEs)

Lastly, kind reminder to send me a couple of your own song ideas ahead of the next lesson. These can be from any genre.

## August 28

Assignment this week: Learn simple tunes in the key of C. RH plays the melody, LH plays triads. We will only use 3 triads right now: the 1, 4, and 5 (C Major (CEG), F Major (FAC), G Major (GBD)).

I have some examples on [this page](/simple). If you'd like more song ideas, check out "101 Gang Songs" by Bing Crosby.

Lastly, could you send me some songs that you'd be interested in working on sometime before our next lesson? That will give me time to listen and prepare a bit.
