Here are a couple classical pieces that might be fun to learn. Give them a listen, and maybe we can start working on one of them in the next lesson.

- [Chopin Waltz No. 19 in A minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-voZrgjUVc)
- [Clementi Sonatina No. 6 in D Major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDlsG7C5PEs)

Lastly, kind reminder to send me a couple of your own song ideas ahead of the next lesson. These can be from any genre.

## August 28

Assignment this week: Learn simple tunes in the key of C. RH plays the melody, LH plays triads. We will only use 3 triads right now: the 1, 4, and 5 (C Major (CEG), F Major (FAC), G Major (GBD)).

I have some examples on [this page](/simple). If you'd like more song ideas, check out "101 Gang Songs" by Bing Crosby.

Lastly, could you send me some songs that you'd be interested in working on sometime before our next lesson? That will give me time to listen and prepare a bit.
