## August 30
- practice finding the note "C" on the piano
- get comfortable finding "C"'s going up and down the keyboard
- play "1 2 3 4 5" starting on C (fingering is not super important right now, should be mentioned and worked on a little bit, but doesn't have to be strict)
- play "1 3 5" starting on C
- improvise with "1 3 5" over [backing track](./backing.mp3) (don't have to strictly follow this rule) -- [example](./example.mp3)
- start learning melody to "Mary Had A Little Lamb", sing or say words as you play with fingers (starting notes: 3 2 1 -- "Ma-ry had...")
- write down a small list of favorite songs, or songs that you want to learn on the piano, and bring to the lesson
- aim for 5 minutes of practice per day
