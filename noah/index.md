## September 20
- [Jingle Bells (melody)](./jingle.mp3) - try to learn it by ear first, then check this afterwards
- [My favorite Christmas albums](/christmas) -- Let's start brainstorming what Christmas song we want to learn for the studio's Winter Recital in mid-December

## September 12
- [repeat after me](./911.mp3) - listen to the phrase and repeat it back (you'll be playing along with the higher piano part)

## August 30
- improvise with "1 3 5" (C E G) over [backing track](./backing.mp3) (don't have to strictly follow this rule)
- when you're improvising, think of making "phrases", short musical sentences -- [example](./example.mp3). Phrases like to start and end on the "downbeat"
- practice learning melodies to simple tunes, starting with "Mary Had A Little Lamb" and "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" -- some examples on [this page](/simple)
- write down a small list of favorite songs, or songs that you want to learn on the piano, and bring to the lesson
- find some other simple tunes that you'd like to learn -- check out "101 Gang Songs" by Bing Crosby if you need some ideas
- aim for 10 minutes of practice per day
