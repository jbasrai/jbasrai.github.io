### Final thoughts leading into recital
- Song is sounding great overall, bridge is the only section that can use some more work, spend some focused time on it so that it's as easy to play as the verse
- Play through the song in your head so that you're clear about the overall form: intro -> chorus 1 -> chorus 2 -> ending

## Dec 3
- [hippo backing track](./backing.mp3) -- this backing track is only 1 chorus, but we will perform 2 choruses of the song (trading in the 2nd chorus)
- [example melody](./hippo.mp3)

## November 25
- Practice playing along with this [backing track](./hippo.mp3)
- I think your piano is a bit out of tune, so [this track](./hippo2.mp3) might fit better

## October 29
### Rhythm exercise
- Use [this backing track](./rhythm.mp3)
- First, clap on the downbeat (beat 1)
- Then, clap half notes (beats 1 and 3)
- Then, clap quarter notes (every beat)
- If this starts to feel easy, try this with a song

### You Are My Sunshine

### I Want A Hippo

## August 30
- improvise with "1 3 5" (C E G) over [backing track](./backing.mp3) (don't have to strictly follow this rule)
- when you're improvising, think of making "phrases", short musical sentences -- [example](./example.mp3). Phrases like to start and end on the "downbeat"
- practice learning melodies to simple tunes, starting with "Mary Had A Little Lamb" and "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" -- some examples on [this page](/simple)
- write down a small list of favorite songs, or songs that you want to learn on the piano, and bring to the lesson

- aim for 10 minutes of practice per day
