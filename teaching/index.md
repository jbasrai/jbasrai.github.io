I love teaching kids of all ages and musical backgrounds. My priority is helping students become well-rounded musicians who enjoy playing music for life.  I believe that everybody is more than capable of achieving this, in the same way that everyone is capable of learning a language or learning to play a sport. It does require a certain amount of commitment. The important ones are: 

1) Access to an acoustic piano OR a high quality digital piano with weighted keys.
2) Regular attendance at lessons.
3) Consistent daily, high-quality practice at home guided by the parent. For younger students, this would be sitting side-by-side during practice. Older students might not need one-on-one attention, but should have help staying accountable with practice.

In addition to weekly lessons, I give my students opportunities to perform music throughout the year (see sample videos above). I also help students meet up and play music together as a group.

My rates are $65/hour. However, my priority is giving equal access to piano lessons. If a student wants to learn piano, but price is an issue let me know, and we can almost certainly work something out.

Best,
Jauhar
