### Other goals for this week

- Tap a steady beat with the LH while playing some of the simpler tunes (tunes that have mostly quarter notes and half notes)
- Continue learning tunes from the 5/30 week

## 6/29

### Goals this week

- Work through the Piano Adventures Lesson Book, reviewing the material starting on page 10 and then continuing on
- Play through some of the tunes we're learning, using the LH to keep time. Start with tapping all 4 beats of the measure, then move on to tapping just the strong beats (beats 1 and 3)
- Continue with "repeat after me" ear training and staff notation flashcards

### Backing tracks for the songs in the lesson book

- [the walking song](629 walking.mp3)
- [two questions](629 questions.mp3)
- [the i like song](629 like.mp3)
- [i hear the echo](629 echo.mp3)

## 6/21

*Main goal this week:* Review some of the old tunes, now using your LH to tap the "strong beats". Feel free to also learn some of the new tunes also that were leftover from last time – you don't have to tap on these.

- [practicing strong beats](https://youtu.be/kgV8WpZkXNk)
- [example of writing in strong beats on "itsy bitsy spider](./621 beats.jpg) - Just like in this example, it might be helpful to write down all the words of the song and also to mark each beat with a ".", before filling in the strong beats. This way you can double check your work by singing the song and clapping along.
