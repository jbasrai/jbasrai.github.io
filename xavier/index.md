### Lesson notes

- Review first line of "Three Green Men" [(recording from lesson)](./men.mp3)
- Maybe start learning second line
- Review playing "Impossible Burgers" song [(recording from lesson)](./burg.mp3)
- Come up with lyrics to end the song. Write them down and bring them to the next lesson. [Here is how the song will sound, come up with words that fit this tune](./burgfull.mp3)
