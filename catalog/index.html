						The Hairdresser's Husband (1990)

						<p>
						The boy dancing.
						Time unknown (widowed man?), the man sits in a dark room trimming his own hair.
						As a child, woolen underwear, off to the barber's, the haircut, marrying a hairdresser, the victory.
						As a married man, the hairdresser, the logical argument.
						As an unmarried man, her story, their meeting.
						As a child, Mrs. Sheffield's suicide, receiving advice about resistance and surrender, building the fort on the beach.
						As a married man, the proposal.
						As an unmarried man, the puffy haircut, the acceptance, the introductions, the marriage, the beard, the dancing.
						As a married man, the man with the angry wife, closing time.
						As a married man, coaxing the child, dancing again.
						As a married man, giving the poet a haircut, the fight, smoking as a child, the cigarette, the bender.
						As a married man, second meeting with the now separated man, life is disgusting.
						As a married man, visiting the old hairdresser at his nursing home.
						As a married man, the men arguing about death, the storm, the suicide, the note.
						As a widowed man, the customer, the dancing, the enigmatic ending.

						What is the dark room?
						When does the child make appearances looking into the barbershop?

						Man's old, stern appearance juxtaposed with his inner child. Coming out in his love of life: in his dancing, in love.
