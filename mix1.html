<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>I wanted to make a tape with good flow from track to track, exploring a few different genres and showcasing some lesser known artists and bands. I mixed together some older tracks which have nostalgic value to me as well as some newer stuff that I've been enjoying.</p>

<h3>Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina - Missa Aeterna Christi Munera: Kyrie</h3>
<p>I liked the idea of telling a story starting at the origins of Western music and leading into the current day. This mix didn't quite realize that, but I think it's a cool effect to start off with a Renaissance-age Mass leading directly into some 1970s blues/soul. The transition is actually quite seamless and it really goes to show how intact the foundations of Western music have remained over time.</p>

<h3>Bill Withers - Hope She'll Be Happier</h3>
<p>I'm usually not a big fan of the singer-songwriter type, but there's something special about this dude.</p>

<h3>Oscar Peterson Trio - Have You Met Miss Jones</h3>
<p>This song is the ultimate chill out, so good.</p>

<h3>G. Love & Special Sauce - Baby's Got Sauce</h3>
<p>Another light song, this concludes the opening "suite" of hymns and blues.</p>

<h3>Feed Me Jack - Definitely You</h3>
<p>Band based in next-door Oakland. These guys are my absolute favorites. Dynamic, grooving music with great melodies, interesting mathy rhythms that keep you on your toes, and a touch of jazz-influenced textures and harmonies - you can't ask for more than that.</p>

<h3>A Perfect Circle - The Outsider</h3>
<p>First heard this song in a WoW PvP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrdQAIfHSfw">video</a> when I was like 12. Good times.</p>

<h3>The Beach Boys - Little Pad</h3>
<p>Needed a breather with a strummin' acoustic guitar to lead into the finale. Smiley Smile is actually the only Beach Boys album I've listened to, but I think it's brilliant.</p>

<h3>King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - Am I In Heaven</h3>
<p>These guys are absolute lunatics coming out of the Melbourne indie music scene. They're outfitted with 4 guitars (1 bass), a harmonica, and 2 drummers. How to listen: close your eyes, listen to the drums throb on 4/4 eighth notes in sync, and move your head up and down really fast.</p>

<h3>Stewart Lee - Political Correctness</h3>
Easter egg / palate cleanser that I threw in last minute. Stewart Lee is the smartest comedian.
