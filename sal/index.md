- [night and day chart](./night_and_day.pdf) - After thinking about it more, it would be more practical to use the chart to help learn the tune. I would play the Frank Sinatra recording below, while reading the chart. Note that the recording right on the chorus of the tune, which is on measure 17 in the chart. A good goal would be to play block chords in the LH whie playing the melody in the RH, we'll talk more about this in the next lesson.

- [teddy wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH4Xo8YipYA) - Sidenote, he plays the tune in the key of Eb. I would also check out the album that this is on, it's called "Teddy Wilson Solo Piano: The Keynote Transcriptions"
