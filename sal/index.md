- Continue improvising over V7 - I vamp. Use "guidetones", starting with 1 note per bar, then 2, etc.
- Do ["repeat after me" ear training](./10-3.mp3) then record and send your own version. Note that I play each phrase twice (with a 2 bar gap in between), so that you have more time to hear it.
- Start learning [Honeysuckle Rose](./rose.png). After thinking about it more, I think this is a better tune to learn than Night and Day right now. The improvisation work we're doing will directly apply to the chords on this tune. Try to start learning the head (melody) of the tune this week.

## September 27

- [night and day chart](./night_and_day.pdf) - After thinking about it more, it would be more practical to use the chart to help learn the tune. I would play the Frank Sinatra recording below, while reading the chart. Note that the recording right on the chorus of the tune, which is on measure 17 in the chart. A good goal would be to play block chords in the LH whie playing the melody in the RH, we'll talk more about this in the next lesson.

- [teddy wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH4Xo8YipYA) - Sidenote, he plays the tune in the key of Eb. I would also check out the album that this is on, it's called "Teddy Wilson Solo Piano: The Keynote Transcriptions"
