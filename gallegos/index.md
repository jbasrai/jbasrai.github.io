## 5/18

### goals for this week

- finding the "downbeat" in any given song
- clapping written rhythms
- learning about the drum kit: hi-hat, snare, and bass/kick drum
- polishing up melody to "Saints" in the second half of the tune
- playing LH bass and RH chords along with "Midnight Special"
- playing "Saints" and "Mary Had A Little Lamb" with LH chords

### instructions for finding the downbeat (beat 1)
- play the music
- count "1 2 3 4" out loud
- if it feels right, begin to clap on beat 1. this marks the downbeat
- if it doesn't feel right, stop counting, listen more, and then restart the count
