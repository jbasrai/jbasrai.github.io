I've decided that the Mario theme might not be the best use of lesson time right now, but here are the notes very slowly if you'd like to learn it on your own.

[first phrase](77 p1.mp3)
[second phrase](77 p2.mp3)
[third phrase](77 p3.mp3)
[full theme](77 under.m4a)

## 5/18

### goals for this week

- finding the "downbeat" in any given song
- clapping written rhythms
- learning about the drum kit: hi-hat, snare, and bass/kick drum
- polishing up melody to "Saints" in the second half of the tune
- playing LH bass and RH chords along with "Midnight Special"
- playing "Saints" and "Mary Had A Little Lamb" with LH chords

### instructions for finding the downbeat (beat 1)
- play the music
- count "1 2 3 4" out loud
- if it feels right, begin to clap on beat 1. this marks the downbeat
- if it doesn't feel right, stop counting, listen more, and then restart the count
