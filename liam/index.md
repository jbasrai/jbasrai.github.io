## October 18
- [backing track for "O Tanenbaum](./tanenbaum.wav)

## October 14
- Listen to [Vince Guaraldi's version of "O Tannenbaum"](./tanenbaum.mp3), specifically listening for how he plays chords and how he plays the melody
- [Backing track, drums + bass](./tanenbaum_mix.mp3) -- practice playing chords in LH and melody in RH
- I'd like to change the way we play the "1" chord. Instead of Eb Major 7 (Eb G Bb D) let's use a Eb Major 6 chord instead: Eb G Bb C. You can also use this inversion: G Bb C Eb.
